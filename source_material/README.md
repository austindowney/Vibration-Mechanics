# Source Material
Source material for the open-source textbook. The main text can be compiled using Open_Vibrations.tex or each each chapter can be compiled on its own in its folder. All figures are stored in a common figure folder to allow for the reuse of figures and generally to keep the document clean. The Making_figures directory contains all the files for making the figures in the text.
